# Arcus Data Default GitHub Metadata

## What is this repo?
We're making our [Arcus Data](https://arcusdata.io) organization-wide GitHub community health files (issue and pull request templates, contributing guidelines, security policy, and code of conduct) available in this repo.

GitHub allows for defaults to be inherited in all organization repos by creating a 
root `.github` repo instead of separate folders in each project. See 
"[Creating a default community health file](https://help.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/creating-a-default-community-health-file)". 
This feature was [announced on February 21, 2019](https://github.blog/changelog/2019-02-21-organization-wide-community-health-files/) on the GitHub blog.


## The defaults don't work for me
No problem. You can [override the configuration](https://help.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/creating-a-default-community-health-file#about-default-community-health-files) by replacing the specific file in your repo's `.github` folder.

## I think we can do this a better way
Open a pull request!
